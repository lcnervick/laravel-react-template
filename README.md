## The Plan

The first day will be spent wire-framing the site with responsiveness in mind. The HTML structure will be built and some CSS styling will be applied to realize the layout.

The second day will be spend styling the content further and adding interactivity via JavaScript.


### Deadline

This will initially be a **two-day** project, but will be improved and built upon like a resume.
